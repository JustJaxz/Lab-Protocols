# Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) Protocol

The following protocol was used to process samples collected on <a href = "https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/NZ/en/product/aldrich/wha1822047?srsltid=AfmBOopnJK2iwi3vVLIDLZJRIBpjNMMrEcfbV680emphWZLAicmn5PNJ">GF/C filters (47 mm diatmeter)</a> using a <a href = "https://www.turnerdesigns.com/10au-field-laboratory-fluorometer">10-AU Fluorometer</a> using acidification protocols defined in <a href = "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38997614_A_Handbook_for_the_Measurement_of_Chlorophyll_a_and_Primary_Production">Evans et al., (1986)</a>. All steps, including the filtration of the sample, were undertaken in a dark room. The following steps are for a single sample filter, however preparation of multiple to *Step 4* streamlines the processing of large numbers of samples over multiple days. For examples, get 20 samples to *Step 4*, leave for the required 12 hours and complete the rest of the procotol with each. Then prepare another 20 samples for the next day.

1)  Place filter paper flat and face up (side with sample on it) in a <a href = "https://www.interlab.co.nz/product/70ml-sample-containers-labelled-polypropylene-sterile/">pottle</a>.

2)  Gently add 10 mL of methanol (MeOH).

3)  Close pottle and wrap in tinfoil (or another light blocking material).

4)  Leave in fridge for minimum 12 hours to complete extraction.

#### AFTER 12 hours

------------------------------------------------------------------------

5)  Pipette 5 mL of supernatant from pottle into glass fluorometer test tube.

6)  Place in fluorometer for initial reading.

7)  Give 20 – 30 seconds to settle.
   *If the reading is successful **write down reading results** and skip to step 13. If the Fluorometer returns the reading **‘OVER’** continue with dilution steps below.*

#### Dilution

8)  For dilutions add 0.5 mL of Chl-a supernatant into a new fluorometer test tube.

9)  Add 4.5 mL MeOH.

10) Place parafilm or thumb with glove on over top of test tube and invert multiple times to mix.

11) Place in fluorometer for ‘initial’ reading.

12) Give 20 – 30 seconds to settle then **write down reading results**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*If the reading successful continue with the rest of the protocol. If it is ‘OVER’ repeat dilution steps again. **REMEMBER to keep track of the number of dilutions complete.***

------------------------------------------------------------------------

13) Add 1-2 drops hydrochloric acid (HCL) to sample in test tube.

14) Place parafilm or thumb with glove on over top of test tube and invert multiple times to mix. 15. Place in fluorometer for ‘second’ reading.

15) Give 20 – 30 seconds to settle then **write down reading results**.
16) Repeat for all other sample filters.
