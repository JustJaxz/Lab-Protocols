### Ethanol precipitation of DNA

This protocol is originally from [here](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/files/hlalab/files/ethanol-precipitation-of-rna_hla.pdf), with some minor adjustments. This is used in preparation for sending DNA samples, as transport is easier with dried samples.

#### Materials

- DNA Sample: 10 - 100 µL extracted DNA
- Sodium Acetate (3M, pH 5.2)   
- 100% cold molecular-grade Ethanol: stored at -20 °C
- 70% Ethanol: made with **nuclease-free water**
- Microcentrifuge Tubes
- Microcentrifuge Capable of 13,000-15,000 x g
- Cold block or ice

#### Protocol Steps

1.  Add: 0.1 vols 3M Sodium acetate (e.g. for a 20 µL sample, add 2 µL)
2.  Add 2.5-3 vols ice cold 100% Ethanol Vortex to mix thoroughly (e.g. For a 20 µL sample, add between 50 and 60 µL).
3.  Precipitate at -20 °C for 1 hour or overnight or -80 °C 1 hr (overnight will give more precipitation if RNA amount is low)
4.  Centrifuge at full speed (13,000 - 15,000 x g), 4 °C for 30 mins.
5.  Wash pellet twice with 0.5ml ice cold 75% Ethanol (made with **nuclease-free water**), spinning at 4 °C for 10 mins each time.
6.  Take Ethanol out, spin quickly (10s at top speed) to remove the trace amount of Ethanol as you can.
7.  Air dry the pellet for 5 - 10 minutes. **Avoid over-drying**, this can make it hard to resuspend the DNA.

#### Re-suspending DNA

8.  Re-suspend in an appropriate volume of *Nuclease free water*.
